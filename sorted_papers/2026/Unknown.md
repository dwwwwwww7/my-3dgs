## 1. SCAR-GS: Spatial Context Attention for Residuals in Progressive Gaussian Splatting

- **英文摘要**: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have allowed for real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services. Some of the most recent progressive compression techniques for these models rely on progressive masking and scalar quantization techniques to reduce the bitrate of Gaussian attributes using spatial context models. While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.   In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features. Our key contribution is an auto-regressive entropy model, guided by a multi-resolution hash grid, that accurately predicts the conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, allowing for coarse and refinement layers to be compressed with high efficiency.

## 2. Clean-GS: Semantic Mask-Guided Pruning for 3D Gaussian Splatting

- **英文摘要**: 3D Gaussian Splatting produces high-quality scene reconstructions but generates hundreds of thousands of spurious Gaussians (floaters) scattered throughout the environment. These artifacts obscure objects of interest and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications. We present Clean-GS, a method for removing background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks. Our approach combines whitelist-based spatial filtering with color-guided validation and outlier removal to achieve 60-80\% model compression while preserving object quality. Unlike existing 3DGS pruning methods that rely on global importance metrics, Clean-GS uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1\% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to the target object. Our multi-stage approach consisting of (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal isolates monuments and objects from complex outdoor scenes. Experiments on Tanks and Temples show that Clean-GS reduces file sizes from 125MB to 47MB while maintaining rendering quality, making 3DGS models practical for web deployment and AR/VR applications.

## 3. Voxel-GS: Quantized Scaffold Gaussian Splatting Compression with Run-Length Coding

- **作者**: Chunyang Fu, Xiangrui Liu, Shiqi Wang, Zhu Li
- **发布时间**: 2025-12-19
- **arXiv链接**: [arXiv:2512.17528v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17528v1)
- **说明**: Accepted by DCC 2026
- **英文摘要**: Substantial Gaussian splatting format point clouds require effective compression. In this paper, we propose Voxel-GS, a simple yet highly effective framework that departs from the complex neural entropy models of prior work, instead achieving competitive performance using only a lightweight rate proxy and run-length coding. Specifically, we employ a differentiable quantization to discretize the Gaussian attributes of Scaffold-GS. Subsequently, a Laplacian-based rate proxy is devised to impose an entropy constraint, guiding the generation of high-fidelity and compact reconstructions. Finally, this integer-type Gaussian point cloud is compressed losslessly using Octree and run-length coding. Experiments validate that the proposed rate proxy accurately estimates the bitrate of run-length coding, enabling Voxel-GS to eliminate redundancy and optimize for a more compact representation. Consequently, our method achieves a remarkable compression ratio with significantly faster coding speeds than prior art. The code is available at https://github.com/zb12138/VoxelGS.

## 4. Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression via Video Codec

- **作者**: Qi Yang, Geert Van Der Auwera, Zhu Li
- **发布时间**: 2025-12-12
- **arXiv链接**: [arXiv:2512.11186v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11186v1)
- **说明**: Accepted by DCC2026 Oral
- **英文摘要**: Current video-based GS compression methods rely on using Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) to convert 3D GS into smooth 2D maps, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the application of GS on lightweight devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to app...

## 5. SF-Recon: Simplification-Free Lightweight Building Reconstruction via 3D Gaussian Splatting

- **作者**: Zihan Li, Tengfei Wang, Wentian Gan et al.
- **发布时间**: 2025-11-17
- **arXiv链接**: [arXiv:2511.13278v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13278v2)
- **说明**: This paper has been submitted to the 2026 ISPRS Congress
- **英文摘要**: Lightweight building surface models are crucial for digital city, navigation, and fast geospatial analytics, yet conventional multi-view geometry pipelines remain cumbersome and quality-sensitive due to their reliance on dense reconstruction, meshing, and subsequent simplification. This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.
